                My name is Austin Gantner. I live in Boulder Colorado with my wife Liz and I work for Google Boulder.  I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology in May of 2015 with a BS in Computer Science.

                <a href="http://github.com/austingantner">GitHub page</a>

                <a href="http://poolpolicegames.com/">Faded</a>
                .  Faded is game that a few friends and I are working on and extremely excited about.  If you want to know more, head over to
